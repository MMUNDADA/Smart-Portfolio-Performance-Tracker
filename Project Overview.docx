Project Title
Smart Portfolio Performance Tracker

Project Overview
The Smart Portfolio Performance Tracker is an AI-powered tool designed to monitor, analyze, and provide insights on the performance of an investment portfolio. It uses a combination of Azure Machine Learning, OpenAI, Cognitive Services, and Databricks to track key financial metrics, predict future trends, and summarize performance insights. This project focuses on creating a scalable, data-driven solution for tracking portfolio performance using public and synthetic data, making it suitable as a learning tool and for personal analysis.

Project Objectives
Data Aggregation and Ingestion: Create a robust pipeline for ingesting financial data (from public APIs), economic indicators, and synthetic company data.
Real-Time Portfolio Analysis: Implement machine learning models to track and predict financial performance metrics such as revenue growth, EBITDA, and net income.
Sentiment Monitoring: Utilize text analytics to gauge public sentiment on portfolio companies or industries using news and social media data.
Automated Insight Generation: Use Azure OpenAI to generate periodic summaries and reports, providing insights into portfolio performance, risks, and opportunities.
Project Scope
Data Sources:

Public Financial Data: Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl for stock and financial metrics.
Economic Indicators: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), World Bank, or OECD for macroeconomic data.
Sentiment Analysis Data: News API or Twitter API for public sentiment on relevant companies or industries.
Synthetic Financial Data: Created data mimicking private portfolio metrics (revenue, growth, etc.).
Azure Tools and Services:

Databricks: Centralized platform for data ingestion, transformation, and exploratory analysis.
Azure Machine Learning: Development of predictive models for key financial metrics and risk flags.
Azure OpenAI: Automated generation of reports and summaries for portfolio performance.
Cognitive Services (Text Analytics): Sentiment analysis of news articles and social media content to track industry sentiment trends.
Outputs and Deliverables:

Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard that displays real-time portfolio metrics, performance trends, and sentiment analysis.
Automated Reports: Periodic, AI-generated reports summarizing portfolio performance, highlighting key insights and areas of concern.
Predictive Analytics: Forecasts of financial performance metrics based on historical data, helping to anticipate trends and identify risks.
Implementation Steps
Data Collection and Preparation:

Integrate public APIs to collect financial and economic data.
Create synthetic financial data to represent a mock private portfolio.
Use Databricks to clean and organize data, ensuring it’s ready for analysis.
Model Development:

Train models in Azure Machine Learning to analyze and predict trends in portfolio metrics, such as revenue growth, EBITDA changes, and risk flags.
Use machine learning to identify patterns and relationships between portfolio performance and market/economic indicators.
Sentiment Analysis:

Use Cognitive Services’ Text Analytics API to analyze sentiment from news and social media sources.
Incorporate sentiment analysis into the dashboard to display market sentiment alongside financial metrics.
Insight Generation and Reporting:

Leverage Azure OpenAI to create narratives and summaries for quarterly performance reviews and monthly reports.
Configure automated alerts or insights that highlight significant changes or risks in the portfolio.
Dashboard Development:

Develop a dashboard in Databricks or Power BI to visualize data, model outputs, and insights.
Include interactive elements for exploring individual portfolio companies, trends, and sentiment scores.
Success Metrics
Data Accuracy: Effective ingestion and transformation of data from multiple sources with minimal discrepancies.
Predictive Model Performance: Achieve acceptable model accuracy for predicting financial metrics and flagging potential risks.
User Engagement: A visually intuitive dashboard that encourages frequent use and exploration of insights.
Insight Quality: Meaningful, actionable insights generated by Azure OpenAI for portfolio reporting and risk assessment.
Future Expansion
Incorporate ESG Metrics: Track environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores for a more holistic view of portfolio performance.
Advanced Risk Analysis: Build models to assess and predict risks from geopolitical events, sectoral downturns, or regulatory changes.
Real-Time Alerts: Implement real-time alerts for significant sentiment changes or economic shocks affecting the portfolio.
Timeline (Suggested)
Weeks 1-2: Data sourcing, synthetic data creation, and pipeline setup in Databricks.
Weeks 3-5: Model development and sentiment analysis integration.
Weeks 6-7: Insight generation and OpenAI integration.
Weeks 8-10: Dashboard development, testing, and refinement.
