For a personal project, you can still build a robust Smart Portfolio Performance Tracker using publicly available or synthetic data. Here’s how you can gather relevant data and structure your project:

1. Financial Data for Public Companies
Source: Use freely available financial data from public APIs or datasets.
APIs: Consider services like:
Yahoo Finance API (through unofficial libraries): Provides access to stock data, financial summaries, and metrics for public companies.
Alpha Vantage: Offers financial data on stocks, Forex, and cryptocurrency.
Quandl: Some datasets are free, especially for historical stock prices and financial ratios.
Data Available: Key financial metrics (like revenue, earnings, and P/E ratios) for public companies that can serve as proxies for real-world portfolio analysis.
2. Market and Economic Indicators
Source: Economic data is often available for free from government sources and can help you analyze how broader trends impact your “portfolio.”
Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED): Offers data on economic indicators such as interest rates, inflation, and GDP.
World Bank and OECD: Provide global economic datasets covering everything from economic growth to industry-specific trends.
Data Available: Data on macroeconomic indicators that you can use to simulate external factors impacting portfolio performance.
3. Sentiment and News Data
Source: Use sentiment analysis on free news sources or social media platforms like Twitter.
News APIs: Google News API or News API offers limited free access to news articles, which can be analyzed using Azure’s Text Analytics for sentiment.
Twitter API: Access tweets related to companies or industries of interest and perform sentiment analysis on this data.
Data Available: Real-time or historical sentiment on specific companies or industries, giving you a sense of public opinion trends.
4. Synthetic Data for Financial Metrics
Source: Generate synthetic financial data if you want a dataset similar to what a private portfolio would have.
Tools: Use Python libraries like NumPy or Pandas to create datasets that mirror typical financial metrics (revenue, net income, expenses) for hypothetical companies.
Data Example: Create several “companies” with quarterly revenue, EBITDA, customer growth, and other metrics that follow realistic patterns.
Suggested Project Structure with These Data Sources
Data Collection: Use APIs and synthetic data to gather and structure portfolio information in Databricks. Databricks can help you store and manipulate this data to create the basis for your tracker.
Data Processing and Analysis:
Azure Machine Learning: Use public company financial data or synthetic data to train models for predicting revenue growth, EBITDA trends, or risk flags.
Azure OpenAI: Generate insights and summaries from your data. For example, create quarterly performance narratives for your synthetic portfolio.
Sentiment Analysis:
Cognitive Services: Use Text Analytics to analyze news or Twitter sentiment to gauge how public sentiment might impact your portfolio.
These public and synthetic data sources will let you develop and test your Smart Portfolio Performance Tracker, making it easy to refine the model without needing access to sensitive company data. Let me know if you’d like more details on setting up the data generation or gathering process!
